# AI-BEE
Albee assessment project.

## Discriminator
### TL;DR
This project has been created based on AI-Bee assessment. Some of the project descriptions were not clear to me so I decided to send an email but I didn't get any answer until now.  
I provide my questions below here and hope to be seen and complete the rest of it.


At the test description, mentioned: " Input: product code or product name, the user's ID, and the invoice final amount. "
1. : Does the product have a price on its model, or should we send the amount (like what the above says) to compute the discount? Also, by according to the description it says, return discount (value) or -1. What should we do with this amount or price?
2. : Why should we use "user's ID"? I think a product will be selected by id, and by considering its category discount and its price, we can calculate the discount. So what is this "user's ID" mean?
